Hi, I'm Eloi LEDOUX, a student in Computer Science.
This project aim to be a simulation of an ecosystem with living creatures evolving within it.
This project will be done in JAVA and in parallel to my college projects, so it may take some time. Also, this project in made using IntelliJ and with IntelliJ's project model.
As I said, this is a personal project made to learn how to manage a project by myself. Any advice/tip is welcomed.

Thank you for reading this, do not hesitate to contact me if you have anything to tell me in relation to this project or my portfolio.
